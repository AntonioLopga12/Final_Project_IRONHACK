## Industry Analysis : Hydrogen


### GUIÓN:

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. On Earth Hydrogen is found in great quantities but mainly combined with other elements, finding it in sustances such as in water and Natural Gas, but it is barely present in our atmosphere, which contains just 0.00005%. This is why, to obtain hydrogen in the gaseous form, it must be produced through extraction from the molecules that contain it and it must be stored.[20]

Hydrogen demand has grown more than threefold since 1975 and continue rising. Is almost entirely supplied from fossil fuels, with 6% of global natural gas and 2% of global coal going to hydrogen production.[4]

Nearly all of the hydrogen produced is used for refining petroleum, treating metals, producing fertilizer, and processing foods. Petroleum refineries use hydrogen to lower the sulfur content of fuels. NASA began using liquid hydrogen in the 1950s as a rocket fuel, and one of the firsts to use hydrogen fuel cells to power the electrical systems on spacecraft.[7]
[FUEL AND ROCKET IMAGE]

Most of hydrogen produced comes from natural gas. The technique used to extract the H2, its called, Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), that involves high-temperature steam (700°C–1,000°C) and methane that is obtained from naural gas[8], this process coproduces carbon dioxide, and emits air Greenhouse Gas (GHG).[9] 
[SMR IMAGE]

Another source of hydrogen as mentioned before is coal, that through a process we can obtain hydrogen. According to Hybrit’s research, a blast furnace emits 1,600 kgCO2 from the combustion of coking coal and oil to produce one ton of crude steel.[11]

These are the cheap and most pullutant ways of obtaining H2.

Nowadays, most of the hydrogen production (>90%) is “grey hydrogen” [12][show the hydrogen calssification image]

“Green hydrogen”, “blue hydrogen” and “turquoise hydrogen” are GHG emissions-free or are characterised by lower GHG emissions-intensity.[12][show the hydrogen calssification image]

The European Green Deal, approved 2020, is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making the European Union (EU) climate neutral by 2050 [10], this is one of the policies and economic plans that are been aprooved by most economic powers in order to stop harmful enviromental emissions.



As mentioned we can obtain Hydrogen from an abundant sustance on earth, thai is... guess???? Water, yes! with zero GMG emissions inthe production process. The actual method to obtained is through electrolisis, a very simple process ,where Oxigen get separated from the Hidrogen, and storage saftly. 
[show electrolisis image process, and explain the process]


If not produced at the consumption site, hydrogen needs to be transported and stored to eventually be delivered to final users. Different means of transportation are available: 

    * Pipelines: used to transport either gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen converted into ammonia;
    * Trucks: used to transport either gaseous hydrogen, or liquid hydrogen, or hydrogen converted into Ammonia or into a Liquid         Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC);
    * Shipping: transporting liquid hydrogen at temperatures below -253°C (requiring a considerable amount of energy for cooling),       or through an intermediate hydrogen carrier such as ammonia or a liquid organic hydrogen carrier.

Based on the distances and volumes of hydrogen, transport costs can widely vary. Newly built pipelines are widely assumed to be the cheapest method to transport hydrogen per unit transported.[13] 

As mentioned before hydrogen is used mostly in oil refining[SMR], treating metals [Pulverized Coal (PC),Oil,NG][15], food process [use hydrogen to make hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine and butter][16] and the production of fertilisers [17]. 
For it to make a significant contribution to clean energy transitions, it also needs to be adopted in sectors where it is almost completely absent at the moment, such as transport, buildings and power generation.[14]
**Plot 2 - H2 demand by industry**


There is an important application of hydrogen in the transportation industry, through the use of fuel cells. Basically the system has tow elements inputs Hydrogen and oxigen, through the technique known as catalysis, the H2 is separated into electrons and protons, the electrons will be driven by a circuit that produces energy. The protones and electrons from the H2 join the oxigen and produce water as waste.[18]

The price of obtaining green Hydrogen, still depends in the electricity cost, representing [ENSEÑAR EL GRAFICO DE PRECIOS] its most expensive ingridient.

    * About 80% of the ammonia produced by industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer. Ammonia is also used as a refrigerant         gas, for purification of water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes and           other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Household ammonia cleaning             solutions are manufactured by adding ammonia gas to water and can be between 5 and 10% ammonia. Ammonia solutions for             industrial use may be concentrations of 25% or higher and are corrosive.

Most hydrogen produced today in the United States is made via steam-methane reforming, a mature production process in which high-temperature steam (700°C–1,000°C) is used to produce hydrogen from a methane source, such as natural gas.structures[2]
