How to proceed:


1. Review available reports:

Look up for current reports and envisage its relevancy in the current market.



2. Approach the correct industry

An industry has sub-parts.

For example, if you look at the chemical industry, you will find sub-industries like Fertilizers, Pesticides, Paints and Varnishes, Organic chemicals.

Therefore, it is important to focus on the relevant industry.

Without this, it will be impossible to draw an accurate industry analysis report.

So, take up an industry and find out the sub-industries. Select the one which suits the company’s purpose.

Moreover, it is worthwhile to look at the different market segments in a particular industry.


3. Demand & supply scenario

Hence, it becomes relevant to look into the demand-supply scenario for a particular product or industry by studying its past trends and forecasting future outlook.

You can do a comparative analysis with other companies competing, in the same manner, to find out the economic health of the company under consideration.

Future demand and supply forecasting help investors understand the viability of future investments in terms of profits and losses.

4. Competitive scenario

This is the most important step in any industry analysis.

In this, you need to study the competitive advantage scenario using Porter’s Five Forces Model.


Five parameters are analyzed to see the competitive landscape.

They are:

Barriers to Entry
Supplier Power
Threat of Substitutes
Buyer Power
Degree of Rivalry



5. Recent developments

Any industry analysis report isn’t just about studying a particular industry on a micro-level.

The analyst needs to incorporate influencing factors at the macro-level.

These macro-level factors include recent industrial developments, innovation in your industry analysis report, sector valuations and global comparative valuation.



6. Focus on industry dynamics

The industry analysis should be specific to a particular industry and thus, it is important to focus and understand the industry dynamics.

Your industry analysis should be in-depth and to-the-point.

For example, if you are tracking the aluminium industry, you should know the per capita consumption in the country.

In India, the per capita consumption of aluminium is 1 Kg, in the USA, it is 25 to 30 Kgs, in Japan, it is 15 Kgs and in Taiwan, it is 10 Kgs.

Apart from consumption, you should also know the production of aluminium worldwide.

The above six steps are important and you, as an analyst, should follow them.

The analysts in private equity, investments banks, equity research firms, investment research firms need this skill and if you know how to do industry analysis, you are ahead of 80% of the aspirants as this will not only impress your interviewer but also add immense value to you and the business owners hiring you.

**Sector Gas y petróleo:**

    - Obtener los datos evolutivos de precio del producto y la accion bursatil a nivel España, por principales empresas. 
    - Visualizar los datos 
    - Llevar a cabo un análisis de los datos


**Sector Hidrógeno:**

    - Obtener los datos del precio de la accion bursatil y la inversion a nivel España en empresas en el sector Hidrógeno (a           ser posible) 
    - Visualizar los datos
    - Llevar a cabo un análisis de los datos

Una vez obtenidos los datos de los tres productos, ver el las posibles relaciones que pueda haber entre la subida del precio del gas y el petróleo con la subida de la demanda y precio del Hidrógeno. 


Teniendo en cuenta los ultimos aconteciemtos del panorama actual, como por ejemplo, la pandemia del Covid 19, el actual conflito entre Rusia y Ucrania ademas de la tensión entre Europa y Rusia, analizar la evolucion del sector energético y aportar conclusiones que puedan dar una vision general del mercado en cuestión.

Siendo el hidrógeno un producto que puede ser obtenenido en local daría una mayor independencia energética al país.
