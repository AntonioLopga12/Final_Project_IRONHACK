### Day 1: Thursday 3rd March 2022.


#### 1.Hydrogen explained:


    - "The Hydrogen element is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of              hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms."
    - "At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas." 
    [18.5] Chemestry-OpenStax College
    - Hydrogen is an energy carrier not an energy souce, meaning it needs a source of energy to be produced. 
    
    
#### 2. Why Hidrogen:


Look for the answer here:

Its the only solution that enable the decarbonization of the Industry, the transition to Zero emissions in the movility sectror and 

The *actual* alternative is electrolysis, which offers the greatest opportunity for the future. This process uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – the benefit being that it produces pure hydrogen with no harmful by-products. Because it uses electricity, it also offers the potential to divert any excess electricity – which is hard to store (like surplus wind power) – to electrolysis, using it to create hydrogen gas that you can store for future energy needs.

   - **Energy storage:** look for storage applictions (Natural Gas)
        - Calefaccion
       
       
       **CORREGIR**
       En cuanto a los coches, depende de las distancias puede salir rentable o no.
       
      
       No se combutionan el H2 por que es mas ineficiente y contamina, por lo tanto hace un porceso y conviete en electricidad. 
           
       
       - Coche electrico ya teiene la energia convertida. 
       
       - Coche H2 tiene que convertir H2 en elctricidad, por lo tanto el H2 sera mas caro que la electriciadad de un coche electrico que ya tiene la conversion echa.  
       
       
       Por eso se dice que el coche de H2 de la ditancia, pues un coche electrico tiene una autonomi a menoro que la del coche H2, pero es mas barata. Con el H2 la autonomia es mayo pero mas cara, pero en mayores distancias es posible que no hubiese que repostar. 
       
       * electrico - 700km cuanto?
       * H2 - 1000km cuanto?
       El hydrogeno es mas caro que la electricidad y siempre lo sera, pues la electricidad es directamente

#### 4. Hydrogen substitude of Petrol & Gas:

Hydrogen comes to subtitude the harmful energy sources such such as SMR,Nantural Gas and Petrol, in the different applications this fuels are used, that are Industrial sector (S)


    - Industrial: substitude of the Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), that is applied to in the different aplications in the industry to obtain Hydrogen: Example - Acelinox uses Natural gas insted of hydrogen, for iron prouction.
    
Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)
Steam reforming or steam methane reforming is a method for producing syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) by reaction of hydrocarbons with water. Commonly natural gas is the feedstock. The main purpose of this technology is hydrogen production.

- Petrol
- Electrolisis

Costo of Electrolisis:

**Excel done by felipe**

Cost of Natural gas (SMR)

**Excel** DO IT!!


* Hydrogen production costs by production source

Price by method: **look for actual price & history price**



- Natural gas            0.9-3.2
- Natural gas with CCUS  1.5-2.9
- Coal                   1.2-2.2
- Renewables             3-7.5

**Comentary**
Even though natural gas is cheaper and easier to obtain has high carbon (CO2) emissions, and the idea is the opposite, to obtain clean energy, thats why will focus in the green hydrogen production via Electrolisis thorugh renewable energy sources.

#### 4. Electrolisi & Promesing method: 


- **Electrolytic Processes:**

Electrolyzers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This technology is well developed and available commercially, and systems that can efficiently use intermittent renewable power are being developed. Learn more about electrolysis.


- **Direct Solar Water Splitting Processes: *In current deveopment**


Direct solar water splitting, or photolytic, processes use light energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. 

Lasted development seems very promessing, is based in the Sequential cocatalyst decoration on Barium Tantalum Oxynitride (BaTaO2N)  towards highly-active Z-scheme water splitting method.

Takashi Hisatomi,co-author of the study, said the results are a “remarkable finding” in this research field. Hisatomi is a professor with Shinshu’s Research Initiative for Supra-Materials in Nagano, Japan, and he has studied BaTaO2N for nearly a decade, he state “This is personally very exciting for me,” he said of the 100-fold improvement. [[1]IEEE Spectrum]

Demonstrate efficient utilization of photoexcited electrons in a single-crystalline particulate BaTaO2N photocatalyst prepared with the assistance of RbCl flux for H2 evolution reactions via sequential decoration of Pt cocatalyst by impregnation-reduction followed by site-selective photodeposition. The Pt-loaded BaTaO2N photocatalyst evolves H2 over 100 times more efficiently than before, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at the wavelength of 420 nm, from a methanol aqueous solution, and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.24% in Z-scheme water splitting. Enabling uniform dispersion and intimate contact of cocatalyst nanoparticles on single-crystalline narrow-bandgap particulate photocatalysts is a key to efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

#### ESTUDIAR SI APORTA INFROMACION O NO!!!  From where is the hydrogen obtain and what are the proportion?


**NOT DEFFINETLY SHOWED**

    - Natural gas 48%
    Steam methane reforming (SMR) is a method of producing hydrogen from natural gas, which is mostly methane. It is currently the    cheapest source of industrial hydrogen. Nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen is being produced by this method.[10] 
    
    - Petrol  30%
    Petroleum coke, abbreviated coke or petcoke, is a final carbon-rich solid material that derives from oil refining, and is one     type of the group of fuels referred to as cokes. Petcoke is the coke that, in particular, derives from a final cracking           process—a thermo-based chemical engineering process that splits long chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains—that     takes place in units termed coker units
    
    - Coal        18%
    For the production of hydrogen from coal, coal gasification is used. The process of coal gasification uses steam and oxygen to     break molecular bonds in coal and form a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. CUSS Technique
    
    - Electrolisis 4%
    Electrolysis consists of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis of water is 70–80% efficient     (a 20–30% conversion loss)[29][30] while steam reforming of natural gas has a thermal efficiency between 70–85%.[31]
