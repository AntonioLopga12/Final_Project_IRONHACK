### Day 1: Thursday 3rd March 2022.


#### 1.Hydrogen explained:


    - "The Hydrogen element is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of              hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms."
    - "At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas." 
    [18.5] Chemestry-OpenStax College
    
#### 2. Why Hidrogen:

#### 2. What are the proportion of the different energy sources used to obtain Hydrogen?
    
    - Natural gas 48%
    - Petrol      30%
    - Coal        18% 
    - Electrolisis 4%

#### 4. Electrolisi & Promesing method: 


- **Electrolytic Processes:**

Electrolyzers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This technology is well developed and available commercially, and systems that can efficiently use intermittent renewable power are being developed. Learn more about electrolysis.


- **Direct Solar Water Splitting Processes: *In current deveopment**


Direct solar water splitting, or photolytic, processes use light energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. 

Lasted development seems very promessing, is based in the Sequential cocatalyst decoration on Barium Tantalum Oxynitride (BaTaO2N)  towards highly-active Z-scheme water splitting method.

Takashi Hisatomi,co-author of the study, said the results are a “remarkable finding” in this research field. Hisatomi is a professor with Shinshu’s Research Initiative for Supra-Materials in Nagano, Japan, and he has studied BaTaO2N for nearly a decade, he state “This is personally very exciting for me,” he said of the 100-fold improvement. [[1]IEEE Spectrum]

Demonstrate efficient utilization of photoexcited electrons in a single-crystalline particulate BaTaO2N photocatalyst prepared with the assistance of RbCl flux for H2 evolution reactions via sequential decoration of Pt cocatalyst by impregnation-reduction followed by site-selective photodeposition. The Pt-loaded BaTaO2N photocatalyst evolves H2 over 100 times more efficiently than before, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at the wavelength of 420 nm, from a methanol aqueous solution, and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.24% in Z-scheme water splitting. Enabling uniform dispersion and intimate contact of cocatalyst nanoparticles on single-crystalline narrow-bandgap particulate photocatalysts is a key to efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
