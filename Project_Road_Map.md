### Day 1: Thursday 3rd March 2022.

GUIÓN:

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, on Earth we can find it in different chemical compositions, such as natural gas[3], petrol,coal and water. Through the different techniques we extract the H2 from them. Hydrogen demand has grown more than threefold since 1975 and continue rising. Is almost entirely supplied from fossil fuels, with 6% of global natural gas and 2% of global coal going to hydrogen production.[4] 

Nearly all of the hydrogen produced is used for refining petroleum, treating metals, producing fertilizer, and processing foods. U.S. petroleum refineries use hydrogen to lower the sulfur content of fuels. NASA began using liquid hydrogen in the 1950s as a rocket fuel, and one of the firsts to use hydrogen fuel cells to power the electrical systems on spacecraft.[7] 

Most hydrogen of the hydrogen produced comes from natural gas. The technique used to extract the H2, its called, Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), that involves high-temperature steam (700°C–1,000°C) and methane obtained from naural gas,[8] that coproduces carbon dioxide, and emits air Greenhouse Gas (GHG).[9] 

Another example, According to Hybrit’s research, a blast furnace emits 1,600 kgCO2 from the combustion of coking coal and oil to produce one ton of crude steel.[11]

The European Green Deal, approved 2020, is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making the European Union (EU) climate neutral in 2050 [10], this is one of the policies that are been aprooved in order to stop harmful enviromental emissions for the greater good and future generations.

“Green hydrogen”, “blue hydrogen” and “turquoise hydrogen” are GHG emissions-free or are characterised by lower GHG emissions-intensity, whereas “grey hydrogen” is GHG emissions-intensive. Nowadays, most of the hydrogen production (>90%) is “grey hydrogen”[12][show the hydrogen calssification image]

As mentioned we can obtain Hydrogen from a very abundant material on earth, thai is... guess???? Water, yes! with zero GMG emissions through the electrolisis a very simple process[show electrolisis image process, and explain the process],where we separate the Oxigen from the Hidrogen, and storage saftly. 
If not produced at the consumption site, hydrogen needs to be transported and stored to eventually be delivered to final users. Different means of transportation are available: 

    * Pipelines: used to transport either gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen converted into ammonia;
    * Trucks: used to transport either gaseous hydrogen, or liquid hydrogen, or hydrogen converted into Ammonia or into a Liquid         Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC);
    * Shipping: transporting liquid hydrogen at temperatures below -253°C (requiring a considerable amount of energy for cooling),       or through an intermediate hydrogen carrier such as ammonia or a liquid organic hydrogen carrier.

Based on the distances and volumes of hydrogen, transport costs can widely vary. Newly built pipelines are widely assumed to be the cheapest method to transport hydrogen per unit transported.[13] 

As mentioned before hydrogen is used mostly in oil refining[SMR], treating metals [Pulverized Coal (PC),Oil,NG][15], food process [use hydrogen to make hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine and butter][16]and the production of fertilisers [17]. For it to make a significant contribution to clean energy transitions, it also needs to be adopted in sectors where it is almost completely absent at the moment, such as transport, buildings and power generation.[14]


There is an important application of hydrogen in the transportation industry, through the use of fuel cells. Basically system has tow inputs Hydrogen and oxigen, through the technique known as catalysis, the H2 is separated into electrons and protons, the electrons will be driven by a circuit that produces energy. The protones and electrons from the H2 join the oxigen and produce water as waste.[18]

    * About 80% of the ammonia produced by industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer. Ammonia is also used as a refrigerant         gas, for purification of water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes and           other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Household ammonia cleaning             solutions are manufactured by adding ammonia gas to water and can be between 5 and 10% ammonia. Ammonia solutions for             industrial use may be concentrations of 25% or higher and are corrosive.

#### 1.Hydrogen explained:


    - "The Hydrogen element is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of              hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms."
    - "At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas." 
    [18.5] Chemestry-OpenStax College
    - Hydrogen is an energy carrier not an energy souce, meaning it needs a source of energy to be produced. 
    
    
#### 2. Why Hidrogen:


Look for the answer here:

Its the only solution that enable the decarbonization of the Industry, the transition to Zero emissions in the movility sectror and 

The *actual* alternative is electrolysis, which offers the greatest opportunity for the future. This process uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – the benefit being that it produces pure hydrogen with no harmful by-products. Because it uses electricity, it also offers the potential to divert any excess electricity – which is hard to store (like surplus wind power) – to electrolysis, using it to create hydrogen gas that you can store for future energy needs.

- **Direct Solar Water Splitting Processes: *In current deveopment**


Direct solar water splitting, or photolytic, processes use light energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. 

Lasted development seems very promessing, is based in the Sequential cocatalyst decoration on Barium Tantalum Oxynitride (BaTaO2N)  towards highly-active Z-scheme water splitting method.

Takashi Hisatomi,co-author of the study, said the results are a “remarkable finding” in this research field. Hisatomi is a professor with Shinshu’s Research Initiative for Supra-Materials in Nagano, Japan, and he has studied BaTaO2N for nearly a decade, he state “This is personally very exciting for me,” he said of the 100-fold improvement. [[1]IEEE Spectrum]

Demonstrate efficient utilization of photoexcited electrons in a single-crystalline particulate BaTaO2N photocatalyst prepared with the assistance of RbCl flux for H2 evolution reactions via sequential decoration of Pt cocatalyst by impregnation-reduction followed by site-selective photodeposition. The Pt-loaded BaTaO2N photocatalyst evolves H2 over 100 times more efficiently than before, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at the wavelength of 420 nm, from a methanol aqueous solution, and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.24% in Z-scheme water splitting. Enabling uniform dispersion and intimate contact of cocatalyst nanoparticles on single-crystalline narrow-bandgap particulate photocatalysts is a key to efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

#### ESTUDIAR SI APORTA INFROMACION O NO!!!  From where is the hydrogen obtain and what are the proportion?


**NOT DEFFINETLY SHOWED**

    - Natural gas 48%
    Steam methane reforming (SMR) is a method of producing hydrogen from natural gas, which is mostly methane. It is currently the    cheapest source of industrial hydrogen. Nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen is being produced by this method.[10] 
    
    - Petrol  30%
    Petroleum coke, abbreviated coke or petcoke, is a final carbon-rich solid material that derives from oil refining, and is one     type of the group of fuels referred to as cokes. Petcoke is the coke that, in particular, derives from a final cracking           process—a thermo-based chemical engineering process that splits long chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains—that     takes place in units termed coker units
    
    - Coal        18%
    For the production of hydrogen from coal, coal gasification is used. The process of coal gasification uses steam and oxygen to     break molecular bonds in coal and form a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. CUSS Technique
    
    - Electrolisis 4%
    Electrolysis consists of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis of water is 70–80% efficient     (a 20–30% conversion loss)[29][30] while steam reforming of natural gas has a thermal efficiency between 70–85%.[31]
